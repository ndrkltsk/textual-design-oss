# textual-design-oss
  Textual design system files for AI code generation. Use these structured text descriptions with AI tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Lovable to generate accurate, style-consistent code. Instead of guessing what "Stripe's style" means, give your AI the exact specs it needs. 

### Usage
Just take the markdown files in this repository and use them as a guide for the AI to generate code: attach the markdown files to the AI as context.
